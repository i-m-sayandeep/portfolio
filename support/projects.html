                    Basically most of my project are uploaded in my <a href="https://github.com/i-m-sayandeep">GITHUB</a>
                Repository. To known them in details or to get the source code of those projects all of you are welcome to 
                visit my githubaccount and you can download it from there.

            <p>
                Basically, I do most of my works in python and aim to be a DATA SCIENTIST in near future, hence most of the projects 
                are related to either data vizualization and analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lets get started-
            </p>

            </div>
           <h3 id="train">Train Time Table</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Basically, this is the first ever project I have done after completing my Python courses.
                This is basically a small GUI which is connected to IRCTC and fetch data from the main serevr. 
                It is very easy to use and work with, as the user just have to put the train number he or she
                wants to know the time table of. On entering the train number and clicking entre the GUI will show 
                the train route and all the stations that will come in the path with timings.
            </p>
           <h3 id='to-do'>TO-DO List</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                This was the project I was assingned to after my winter internship program. The aim of this project was to
                make a simple GUI and connect it to a database which will basically keep records of your day-to-day work.
                This is basically a digital way of keeping a pocket dairy where people note down their work and strike off
                after finishing and also keeps records of previously done work. A sample of this project is also uploaded in my
                YouTube Channel.
            </p>
           <h3 id="mit">Heart Arrhytmia analysis</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                This was one of the key projects of my career. This is basically a work of data vizualtiona and data analysis.
                This is  a project which is of combining engineering and medical knowledge. Lets cutt it off short as it will take
                nearly 10,000 of words to explain how the system work. For common people, its basically a system which records 
                ones heart beat and can automatically detect if there is any presence of heart diseases inside the person. If you wanna 
                know more about it please to visit my GITHUB account where you will get a clear and descriptive information about this 
                project. 
            </p>
           <h3 id='movie'>Movie Recomendation Sytsem</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This is another example of Data analysis project. Well it is very simple to understand. Just you need to
                put a name of the movie you have recently watched or any movie you like very much and want to see movies like that
                the system will basically suggest you top 50 movies similiar to that movie. It is very common projects among people
                working and learning Data Vizualization.
            </p>
