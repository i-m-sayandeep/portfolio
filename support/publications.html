                Well I am new to the field of research. Till now I have done two reserch papers in colloboration
                with my friend <b>Mr. Suman Kumar Mal</b> and two of my proffessors in college ( <b>Dr. Subhankar Joardar and Mr. Sumanta Kuila</b> ).
                Nevertheless hoping to publish more of my papers in near future.

                                Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the analysis of theelectrical movement of the heart over a period of time. The
                detailed information about the condition of the heart is measuredby analyzing the ECG signal. Wavelet transform, fast Fourier
                transform are the different methods to disorganize cardiacdisease. The paper elaborates the survey on ECG signal analysis
                and related study on arrhythmic and non arrhythmic data. Herewe discuss the efficient feature extraction process for
                electrocardiogram, where based on position and priority six bestP-QRS-T fragments are studied. This survey examines the the
                outcome of the system by using various Machine learningclassification algorithms for feature extraction and analysis of
                ECG Signals. Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-NearestNeighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are the most
                important algorithms used here for this purpose. There are severalpublicly available data sets which are used for arrhythmia
                analysis and among them MIT-BIH ECG-ID database is mostlyused. The drawbacks and limitations are also discussed here and
                from there future challenges and concluding remarks can bedone

            <h2>Performance Analysis of ECG Arrhythmia
                Classification based on Different SVM Methods</h2>
                <hr>

                Heart arrhythmias are the different types of
                heartbeats which are irregular in nature. In Tachycardia the
                heartbeat works too fast and in case of Bradycardia it works too
                slow. In the study of different cardiac conditions automatic
                detection of heart arrhythmia is done by the classification and
                feature extraction of Electrocardiogram(ECG) data. Various
                Support Vector Machine based methods are used to analyze and
                classify ECG signals for arrhythmia detection. There are several
                Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods used to classify the ECG
                data such as one against all, one against one and fuzzy decision
                function. This classification detects the existence of the
                arrhythmia and it helps the physicians to treat the heart patient
                with more accurate way. To train SVM, the MIT BIH Arrhythmia
                database is used which works with the heart disorder like sinus
                bradycardy, old inferior myocardial infarction, coronary artery
                disease, right bundle branch block. All three methods are
                implemented in proper way, and their rate of accuracy with SVM
                classifier is optimal when it is processed with the one-against-all
                method. The data sets of ECG arrhythmia are usually complex in
                nature, so for the SVM based classification one-against-all
                method has great impact and will fetch better result.
